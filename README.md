ListNote is an idea that I had to enable users to create to-do lists to better
organize their time. I was inspired to create this application because I love
making lists, but I've had some frustration in not having access to an
application that differentiated between the different kinds of to-do lists I'd
use. It was much easier for me to just write things down on a piece of paper.
ListNote changes that by allowing me to create different kinds of lists, so I
am no longer dependent on a piece of paper to get the functionality that I need.

ListNote will ultimately allow users to create 3 kinds of lists: A 'chore'
to-do list, which allows users to list all the things they need to do around the
house (e.g. do laundry, make dinner, wash dishes, etc); an 'errand' to-do list,
which allows users to list all the things they nred to do outside the house
(e.g. pick up dry-cleaning, drop kids off at soccer practice, get groceries,
etc); and a 'to-get' list, where users can list all the things they need to
get (e.g. list of groceries to buy, list of Christmas gifts to get, etc).

User Stories:
As a user, I want to be able to make multiple kinds of to-do lists (e.g. one for
groceries to buy, one for places to go to run errands, one for chores to do at
home, etc), so that I can organize my life.
As a user, I want each list to have a do-by or do-on date attached to it.
As a user, I want to set reminders to finish my to-do lists by a certain time,
so that I can have a reminder to do them when they need to be done.
As a user, I want to be able to cross off items as I do them so I can feel a
sense of accomplishment when I finish something.
